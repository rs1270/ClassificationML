This projectâ€™s solution has significant potential across various cybersecurity domains:

1. Security Operations Centers (SOCs):
Automates incident triage by accurately classifying cybersecurity events. This allows analysts to focus on critical threats, enhancing operational efficiency.

2. Automated Incident Response:
Guides response workflows by suggesting appropriate actions for various incident types, reducing reaction times and mitigating potential damages swiftly.

3. Threat Intelligence Enhancement:
Strengthens threat detection by integrating historical data and user feedback into the triage process, improving the accuracy of true and false positive identification.

4. Enterprise Security Optimization:
Enhances overall security management by minimizing false positives and ensuring timely attention to genuine threats, improving an organization's security posture.

Project Methodology:
Data Exploration and Understanding:
Initial Review: Loaded and examined the train.csv dataset to understand data structure, variable types, and class distributions (TP, BP, FP).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted visual and statistical analyses to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and assess class imbalances for future handling.
Data Preprocessing:
Missing Data Treatment: Identified gaps and applied strategies like imputation or row removal to ensure data completeness.
Feature Engineering: Developed new features (e.g., time-based) and transformed existing ones to enhance model performance. Normalized numerical variables for consistency.
Categorical Data Handling: Transformed categorical features into numeric forms using methods such as one-hot encoding or label encoding and Frequency Encoding.
Data Partitioning:
Train-Validation Split: Divided data into training and validation subsets (e.g., 80-20), maintaining class distribution through stratified sampling where necessary.
Model Development and Training:
Baseline Establishment: Implemented initial models like logistic regression to set a performance benchmark.
Advanced Model Exploration: Trained advanced models (Random Forests, XGBoost)
Cross-Validation: Used k-fold validation to assess model consistency and prevent overfitting.
Model Evaluation and Optimization:
Performance Assessment: Measured macro-F1 score, precision, and recall, ensuring balanced performance across all classes.
Model Interpretation and Analysis:
Feature Impact: Assessed key feature contributions using SHAP values or other importance measures.
Error Diagnosis: Conducted error analysis to identify patterns in misclassifications, informing further refinement steps.
Final Testing and Review:
Test Set Evaluation: Validated the final model on the test.csv dataset, comparing its performance with the baseline model.
Result Validation: Ensured consistency between validation and test results, reinforcing reliability.
Outcomes:
The project aims to deliver:

A machine learning model capable of accurately classifying cybersecurity incidents (TP, BP, FP) with high precision, recall, and macro-F1 score.
Insights into feature importance and model performance.
Comprehensive documentation outlining the development process, challenges faced, and actionable recommendations for SOC integration.
